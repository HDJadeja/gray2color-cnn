# gray2color-cnn
A simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that learns to colorize grayscale images using the CIFAR-10 dataset.  Built with TensorFlow and Keras, this project demonstrates basic image preprocessing, CNN design, and image reconstruction from single-channel (grayscale) input to three-channel (RGB) output.
